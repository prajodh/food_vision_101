Introduction
Food Vision 101 aims to leverage the power of deep learning and transfer learning to create an intelligent system capable of recognizing and categorizing different cuisines. The model at the core of this project is built upon the EfficientNet B0 architecture, known for its efficiency and accuracy in image classification tasks.

Project Highlights
EfficientNet B0: We employ the state-of-the-art EfficientNet B0 architecture as the backbone of our model. This allows us to achieve remarkable accuracy in recognizing food items.

TensorFlow Data Loading Pipelines: To ensure smooth and efficient data handling, we make use of TensorFlow's data loading pipelines. This optimizes the flow of data from the dataset library to the model, enhancing overall performance.

Mixed Precision Training: For faster training times and reduced memory consumption, we implement mixed precision training. This technique exploits the potential of modern GPUs, making the training process faster and more efficient.
